"""
Tier 2a: Write-time contradiction check on palinode_save (ADR-004).

When enabled, every save schedules a background contradiction check against
similar existing memories. Runs asynchronously via an in-process asyncio queue
(when the API server is handling the save) or via disk-backed marker files
(when the save comes from a CLI or plugin path without a long-lived worker).

Errors in the check are logged but never propagate to the save caller. The
save-never-fails invariant is load-bearing — see ADR-004 for rationale.

A disk marker is the durable record of a job, so it outlives the enqueue: the
sweep hands a copy to the worker and leaves the file in place, and only a
completed run deletes it. A worker that times out, dies, or takes the process
down with it therefore leaves the job pending for the next sweep instead of
consuming it. Retries are bounded by ``write_time.max_attempts`` (3), counted
in the marker itself so a restart cannot reset the bound; past it the marker
is retired to ``.failed.json`` with the reason logged, because a poison job
that loops forever and a marker that can never be cleared are both outages.

The queue carries one other job kind. A ``revalidate`` item (written by
:func:`palinode.core.revalidation.enqueue_revalidation`) is deterministic
deferred work: it calls no LLM, re-derives its decision from live disk, and
records a record's current backing state in its frontmatter. It rides this
queue because this is where deferred memory writes already go — the same
marker format, the same startup and idle sweeps, the same ``.failed.json``
surface when one cannot be applied, and the same ``git_tools`` commit path.

    save used to land in the target as a single line carrying every fact id
    it contained, duplicating each of them. A text-less DELETE is what the
    checker means by "this fact is retired"; the executor's ARCHIVE is that
    op, and its ADR-020 guard rejects it on a superseded-only (identity)
    document rather than forging a successor. A text-less UPDATE says nothing
    the executor could apply, so it is dropped rather than guessed at.

    The contradiction check retrieves candidates across every stored file,

    was therefore dropped as ``unmatched`` (the fact is not in the saved
    file), and one naming an id that happens to exist in *both* the saved
    file and a candidate mutated the saved file's copy — the wrong target.

    Ownership is resolved against the candidate rows the proposal was
    generated from, not a store-wide lookup: the model could only name a fact
    it saw. Three outcomes per op:

    * exactly one candidate file carries the id → the op goes to that file,
      **provided** the candidate section it was proposed against is still
      what is on disk (``store.check_freshness`` against the row's
      ``content_hash``). A stale section means the target changed between
      proposal and application; the op is rejected as ``stale_rejected``
      rather than applied last-write-wins.
    * more than one candidate file carries the id → ``ambiguous_rejected``.
      The executor could only ever pick one, and there is no deterministic
      way to know which the model meant.
    * no candidate carries the id → the op goes to the saved file, exactly
      as before. The executor reports it ``unmatched`` if the id is not there
      either.
