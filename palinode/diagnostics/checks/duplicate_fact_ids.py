"""Check: status_fact_ids_unique

A fact id is an address: the executor resolves ``<!-- fact:id -->`` to a line
and rewrites, retires or retracts *it*. An id carried by two lines is not an
address — an UPDATE aimed at one rewrites both, an ARCHIVE of one retires both.

That happened for real. Session-end derives the id from the line's text, so two
byte-identical log lines — a repeated summary, the same session ending twice —
minted the same id, and nothing checked the document for a collision. The first
live age sweep logged six ``ARCHIVE unmatched`` warnings for five ids: the first
ARCHIVE had already taken every line its id named, so the per-line ops behind it
found nothing.

Minting is fixed at both writers, so no new duplicate appears. This is the
operator's view of the ones already on disk: nothing is lost while they sit
there — retirement still removes every line — but any op the compaction model
aims at one of them hits the others too, and that is worth seeing before the
executor surfaces it as a warning nobody was watching for.

``fast``: globs one directory and reads the status documents in it — no network,
no index access, no walk.
